# Progressive Fee System - starting with version 1.1.0

# Introduction

The progressive fee system is a mechanism that allows users to pay a fee based on the size of the transaction they are sending. This is a way to help users automate roll buying with smaller transactions fees on our app.

# How it works

The progressive fee system works by charging a fee based on the size of the transaction being sent. The fee is calculated based on the number of rolls of the biggest staking address. This means that users who send larger transactions will pay more in fees than users who send smaller transactions.

# Example

For example, if the system buys a number of rolls equal or bigger than the biggest staking address roll balance, the fee will be 1000 $MAS, which is the max fee. We have a minimum fee of 1 $MAS. This means that the fee will not be less than 1 $MAS. The max fee is reached when the system buys a number of rolls equal or bigger than the biggest staking address roll balance.

# Benefits

- **Fairness**: The system ensures that users are paying a fee that reflects the resources. This helps to ensure that users are paying a fair and transparent fee.

# Conclusion

The progressive fee system is a mechanism that allows users to pay a fee based on the size of the transaction they are sending. This is a way to help small balance users to pay less fees, especially when the rolls get autosold and the system buys new rolls.
